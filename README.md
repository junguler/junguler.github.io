my work in progress website, i moved this markdown file to the old-README.md for archival purposes, i'll try to explain what i've learned better this time

### first step
make a github account, start a new repo with your user name and add `.github.io` at the end of it

### make index.html
make a new file named `index.html` this will be your home page, lets put the basic stuff in it
```
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    My text goes here.
</body>
</html>
```
what happened? everything html has to be inside tags `<>` there are many different tags for different needs and we'll go over some of them here, the html tag is most basic one, note when you start a tag that has beginning and and end we'll add a `/` before the actual tag when we want to end it . so `<html>` starts it `</html>` will end it

the header tag is for everything at the top of our page, the body is everything in the middle of our page and there is also a footer tag that's not really needed for now ...

### some basic tags and how to use them
title: sets title of your page which is shown in the browser tab bar
```
<title>junguler</title>
```
p: sets up a paragraph to be written inside of it
```
<p>
my paragraph, can be many one or many lines
</p>
```
a: inserts link to a page
```
<a href="https://www.google.com/">google website</a>
```
img: add an image into your page
```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="some info">
```
