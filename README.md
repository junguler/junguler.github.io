this will eventually become my personal website, little progress have been made already toworeds that goal but i suspect it's going to be a long process but one thing i have is patience so it's fine by me.

what i've learned so far:
- [x] add website title and icon on tab bar
- [x] upload a picture to repo and link it 
- [x] center everything in the page
- [x] link some sites
- [x] have a link to email me with emails clients

what i'm planning to do in the near future:
- [ ] draw a border around the whole page and specify page height and width for the site
- [ ] add icons for each page and link the websites to the icons
- [ ] add bling, pictures, animated gifs, videos
- [ ] change fonts for everything
- [ ] replace the basic avatar with animated pciture, preffebly with fake 3d effect from G'mic
- [ ] add different sub-pages whitin the site
- [ ] learn some basic css to make life easier
- [ ] and ...
