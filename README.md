this will eventually become my personal website, little progress have been made already toworeds that goal but i suspect it's going to be a long process but one thing i have is patience so it's fine by me.

#### what i've learned so far:
- [x] add website title 

set the page title`<title>junguler</title>` 

- [x] set icon on tab bar

set page icon in the tab bar `<link rel="icon" type="image/ico" href="stuff/favicon.ico"/>` here i've uploaded `favicon.ico` to the stuff folder of this repo, head over [this site](https://iconifier.net/) to convert your image to favicon

- [x] upload a picture to repo and link it 

upload your image to a folder in the repo, `stuff` in this case and link it `<img src="stuff/avatar.jpg"/>`

- [x] center everything in the page

start centering with `<center>` at the beeging and end it with on the last few lines `</center>`

- [x] link some sites

link a wbsite like this `<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/junguler">deviant art page</a>` the first part is the actual link, the second part is what people see on your site

- [x] have a link to email me with emails clients

same as above, the first part is the actual email, the second part is what people see`<a href = "mailto: junguler@yahoo.com">email: junguler@yahoo.com</a>`

- [X] apply a border around the page
- [X] change background color to black and text to white
- [X] apply margin spacing to left and right of the page

```
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:50px;margin:0px 150px 0px 150px;border-style: solid; border-width:5px;border-color: white;">
```
specify background and text colors `background-color:black;color:white` specify the distance each element will have to each outher `padding:50px` specify border margin (un-available area in the page) the order is top, right, bottom, left `margin:0px 150px 0px 150px` specify the border width and color `border-width:5px;border-color` the whole line is covered in double quates `""` and each part is seperated by `;`

use `<h1>header</h1>` for header text, for writing prographs start with `<p>` and end with `</p>`, use `<br>` for line breaks and put everything in `<body>everything</body>`

- [X] change font size

use the font tag `<font size="5"> <p>your size 5 paragraoh</p> </font>` more examples can be found [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_fonts.htm)

- [X] change link colors

`<a href="web link" style="color:yellow">what people see on the site</a>` or use `#FF0` or `#ffff00` for the same yellow color

#### what i'm planning to do in the near future:
- [ ] add icons for each page and link the websites to the icons
- [ ] add bling, pictures, animated gifs, videos
- [ ] change fonts for everything, add a [nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) to this repo and use it's glyphs
- [ ] replace the basic avatar with animated picture, preferably with fake 3d effect from G'mic
- [ ] add different sub-pages whitin the site
- [ ] learn some basic css to make life easier
- [ ] and ...
